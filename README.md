# Seans' Transport Hub


Welcome to my Transport App.


This app will be my first big project branching away from tutorials and doing my own ideas. I will be using different websites and apps to help me build and design this so that I can make a fuly fledged app that will be a great example of my experience and show case my skills.

This project will be starting as a django app using the rest framework. Its running a postgres db on railways. Railwways is a hosting website https://railway.app/
The front end will be running on REACT. https://github.com/seanmalan/athop-frontend is where the project is located.


I have a word doc with my initial ideas and plan for the app. This will be updated as I go along. 


To use this app simply clone the project to your desktop. Open the folder in vscode. Open your terminal using control + J. type in
  scripts\activate
  pip install djangorestframework
  pip install django-cors-headers
  pip install python-dotenv
  pip install psycopg2
  pip install djangorestframework-simplejwt
  python manage.py runserver
This will start up the back-end server and you will be able to use the API.
